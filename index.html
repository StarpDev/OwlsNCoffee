    <h1>Owls 'n Coffee</h1>
    <p class="blog">After a five-mile trek up one of the rockiest mountains in Yosemite, I finally made it to the main site of attraction, Yosemite Falls. The magnificent waterfall, which was at least 2,000 feet high, poured down into the clear pool that was hidden behind the pine trees at the bottom of the valley. <br><br> Without saying a word, I quickened my pace to get a better view of the water. As I descended the mountain trail, the sound of crashing rapids and the scent of vegetation became more evident. Every minute, the urge to sprint down the hill to the waterfall doubled, and at last, I couldn’t resist anymore. I ran as fast as my legs could take me, and everything but the waterfall blurred out. <br><br>I knew my family was calling to me from behind, but I didn’t care because the only thing that mattered to me was to admire the natural wonder in front of my eyes.
